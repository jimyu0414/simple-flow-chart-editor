# simple-flow-chart-editor

The App was write with npm 'express' backend and 'create-react-app' front end. 
all additional packages can be found in the dependencies from two 'package.json' of backend folder and front end folder.

To start the app, just cd the main folder path and run 'npm run dev'

Or, you can start two local servers  separately:

- run 'npm run server' to start backend localhost:3001
- run 'npm start' to start front end localhost:3000

If there is an error on starting(I found this happens when I develop this in different systems), I recommend to remove the node__modules folder on both  and install the npm modules again, then it would be working all fine.
